### Projects

[Halite III - Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/hsperr/halite-3-reinforcment)
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1778723/72680785-25c3af00-3abe-11ea-909d-109d440b0fde.gif"/>

A series on how to implement deep reinforcement learning on non openAI gym examples. We have to write everything from scratch and come up with our own rewards and state representations.

[Youtube Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTFKYT5hEk&list=PLzCNQAa0rQnrs-RftLV4eHRq41aSW30Uk)

[StackIt](https://github.com/hsperr/StackIt)
<img src="images/stackit.gif?raw=true"/>

We implement a simple game from scratch and implement minmax/MC tree search and eventually want to implement AlphaGo style algorithm to play the game.

[Chengine](https://github.com/hsperr/Chengine)

While in Univeristy a friend challenged me to write a chess engine in C. So here it is, while the code is not the cleanest its a fully functioning chess engine that will beat the average chess player.

[BetterDateTime](https://github.com/hsperr/BetterDateTime)

A wrapper around python datetime to have convenience methods similar to javas Joda time. For what I needed it, it works but I would not recommend using it. I should have wrapped this around pyarrow or in general just not touch datetime libraries. I know it has some bugs depending on your usecase.

---
[Japanese Meanings](https://github.com/hsperr/japanese_meanings)

A simple Anki plugin which will insert the english meanings and katakana spelling for kanji inserted into Anki. This makes it a lot easier to insert many words at once.


---
[Kaggle Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/hsperr/finding-ensamble-weights)

I don't kaggle much, but one competition I entered and participated in the community I contributed a kernel that helped many people ensembling models and netted me being featured on the kaggle blog.
